NSS Final Capstone - Comparing the 2008 Recession to the Coronavirus Recession

Executive Summary:
Since February we have heard a lot about the ‘Coronavirus Recession’. We’ve often heard it compared to the 2008 financial crisis. I plan on examining multiple economic and market indicators to examine if it is an equivalent comparison.

Motivation:
We entered our first week of NSS right as the Coronavirus caught not only our governments attention, but the American Economy’s as well. The week prior, myself and several of my classmates resigned from full time jobs to attend NSS. When we initially signed up, the timing was opportune. The Nashville Job Market was a candidates market. We were sure our next career step was only 15 weeks away. Although I still believe there is a lot of opportunity in the Nashville market, it is still uncertain.

My motive here is to compare the two time periods, and see how similar or unsimilar they are to shed light and insight on the next 18 months.

Data Questions:
How similar is the current economic climate to the 2008 financial crisis?
Is it a fair comparison?
